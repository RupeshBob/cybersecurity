## 1. Abstract
CyberGuard is an all-in-one cybersecurity web application that empowers users to:
- Instantly check URLs for phishing using the VirusTotal API v3  
- Detect scam or malicious text messages with rule-based pattern analysis  
- Assess password strength in real time with detailed feedback  

By consolidating three essential security utilities into a single responsive UI, CyberGuard helps individuals and small organizations quickly identify and remediate common threats.

## 2. Problem Statement
With the surge in phishing campaigns and social-engineering scams, non-technical users often lack accessible tools to:
1. Verify whether a link is malicious before clicking.  
2. Spot scam or phishing messages masquerading as legitimate communication.  
3. Choose strong passwords that resist brute-force and dictionary attacks.  

CyberGuard addresses these gaps by offering an intuitive interface backed by industry-grade APIs and rule sets.
